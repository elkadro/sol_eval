# Basic Solidity Problems Dataset

The benchmark consists of solidity programming problems, designed to be solvable by entry level programmers, covering solidity fundamentals, standard library functionality, and so on. Each problem consists of a prompt, code solution and 3 automated test cases.

As described in the paper, a subset of the data has been hand-verified by us. This data is `sanitized-sol-eval.json`.

The dataset is in a .jsonl format (json per line).
